# Nand2Tetris Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the Nand2Tetris course projects. Nand2Tetris is a course that guides students through building a modern computer system from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates (NAND) all the way to a high-level programming language and operating system.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different project folders, each corresponding to a specific part of the computer system:

- Project 12: Operating System
  - Implementation of core OS classes (Array, String, Memory, Math)
  - Test programs for verification

## Technologies Used

- Hardware Description Language (HDL)
- Assembly Language
- Jack Programming Language
- VM Language

## Course Overview

Nand2Tetris (also known as "From Nand to Tetris" or "The Elements of Computing Systems") takes you through the following layers of abstraction:
